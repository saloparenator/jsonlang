user function cannot be used inside predicate
predicate dont transform data, it only test it.

why:
  if predicate contain function and function contain predicate, we risk infinite recursion
  predicate should not have side effect. thus implementation function can

imply:
  calculate trajectory first then test it

anyway:
  you will have sugar synthax

function call could only have reference and d√©claration at call

why:
  because i am leasy
  anyway, it is always preferable to not make inner call

imply:
  you cant call functionA(functionB(value))
  you'd better say
  retB = functionB(value)
  retA = functionA(retB)

anyway:
  will debuging, you always end up declare everything and monitor it.

you should always name your return value.
but it is not enforced
because there are function that are side effective

decision:
predicate engine is completely separated from transformation engine.
they have their own synthax and mecanic.
function dont do any comparision either
